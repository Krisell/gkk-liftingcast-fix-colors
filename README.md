# Update Liftingcast "Board view" colors to work with projection on black background

This intends to flip some of the colors from white text on black background to the opposite, in order to show more clearly when projected on a black background.

## How to use

1. Download the source code, `git clone` or the zip file, by clicking on the green "Code" button here at GitHub.
2. In Google Chrome, enter `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar and press enter
3. Click on the `Load unpacked` button (you might have to enable `developer mode` first), and locate the folder where the project was saved.
4. If you click on the extension to the right of the address bar, you see a simple UI where you can toggle color changes on and off.
